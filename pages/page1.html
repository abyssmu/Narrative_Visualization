	Introduction

<p>
	The COVID-19 pandemic has been a tremendous burden. It's destroyed communities and families, and even ravaged whole countries.
	Even larger, more capable countries struggled stem the tide, leaving lasting damage throughout the world. In the USA,
	the two main schools of thought regarding the pandemic were acceptance and denial. Some listened to health professionals, laws,
	and regulations regarding safety and healthcare while others ignored them.
	<br>
	<br>
	In total, there have been over 768 million cases and almost 7 million deaths confirmed per <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">data</a>
	from the World Health Organization. Despite having only 335 million of the almost 8 billion people (~4%), <a href='https://www.census.gov/popclock/'>source</a>,
	the USA accounted for over 103 million (~13%) of the total cases and over 1 million (~15%) of the total deaths in the world.
	<br>
	<br>
	Although the US was not alone, its large global presence frames it as a leader in many lights. Many onlookers watched as it floundered
	while trying to curb rising cases and death tolls around the nation. This dataset takes a look at the performance of each state and compares COVID
	data (total and daily cases, total and daily deaths, and each of those per capita) with economic (median income), geographic (population,
	population density, and functional land area (km<sup>2</sup>)), and time (date). The economic and geographic data can be compared
	further with the political color axis, which shows the politcal alignment of the state's governor, senate, and house at the start of
	2020, and the state's electoral results in the 2020 election.
