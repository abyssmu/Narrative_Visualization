<h1>
	y-axis (COVID) and x-axis (time)
</h1>
<p>
	The COVID data initially came in two groups: cumulative cases and cumulative deaths by date. That data was
	expanded with calculations to include the daily values for both, as well as the per capita values for all
	4 of those. This resulted in 8 total values for the y-axis.
	<br>
	<br>
	The data was reported on a mostly daily frequency. There are gaps around the holiday season (Christmas around
	new years) which lead to some spikes in the graph of the daily reports, and disjointed links in all of it.
	<br>
	<br>
	All of this data was graphed using a line graph due to the time component. The scales are linear.

<h1>
	x-axis (economic, geographic, political)
</h1>
<p>
	The economic, geographic, and political data include median income, population, population density, and functional
	land area (km<sup>2</sup>). Median income and population were taken from 2019 values to prevent any potential
	effects of the pandemic. Population density is calculated from population and functional land area. The
	functional land area (km<sup>2</sup>) was calculated from each state's protected land subtracted from its total
	land area. The protected lands used were national parks, conservation zones, shores (sea and lake), forests,
	and prairies. These lands are protected from permanent habitation and will thus skew any density calculation.
	So they were excluded from the land area.
	<br>
	<br>
	Due to common large differences in the data, linear scales yielded rather squished looking graphs with extreme
	outliers. So logarithmic scales are used for both the x- and y-axes to prevent any exponential looking graphs from
	appearing.
	<br>
	<br>
	Since both the x- and y-axes are quantitative data with these measurements, it was all graphed using a scatter plot.
	For each COVID measurement, the largest value was chosen when plotting the points.
