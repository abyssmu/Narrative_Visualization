<h1>
	Population
</h1>
<p>
	Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most easy to predict relation is population and the number of cases. I.e. the greater the population,
	the more cases you would expect the state to have. Switching the variables slightly yields much different results. Changing to
	cumulative cases per capita and population density show that there is almost no correlation between two.
