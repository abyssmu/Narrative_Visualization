<h1>
	Seasonal Trends
</h1>
<p>
	Using the date measurement for the x-axis, you can see various trends in the number of cases and deaths,
	and in their corresponding daily and per capita measurements as well. One such trend is the seasonal trend.
	Notice around both winter seasons for nearly every state there is a sharp rise in reported values. For
	a disease such as COVID-19, one might expect that there would be larger spikes during the summer months
	when people are interacting more frequently. However this is not the case.
