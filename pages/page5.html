<h3>
	Axes
</h3>
<p>
	At the top of the page are the drop down menus corresponding to the various axis. From left
	to right they are: state axis, y-axis, x-axis, color-axis. There are many combinations to
	choose from. You are encouraged to explore as many as you wish.
	<br>
	<br>
	Note: when the "Date" is selected on the x-axis, the color-axis is disabled as it is not
	relevant to the corresponding line graph. Inversely, when any other x-axis measurement is
	selected, the state-axis is disabled for the same reason.
</p>
<h3>
	Tooltips
</h3>
<p>
	Data at each point in the graph for both the line graph and scatter plot is available as a
	tooltip. Simply hover over the points on the scatter plot to see the data corresponding to
	that point. For the line graph, your cursor's position will be tracked when on the graph,
	displaying the value for the nearest x-axis point and it's corresponding y-axis value.
